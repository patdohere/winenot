	  		<h1>History of wine</h1>
		  		<br><br><p>
			    Wine has a rich history dating back thousands of years. First developed in circa 6000 BC in Georgia, it has been celebrated as the drink of the gods by the ancient Egyptians, fueled social gatherings in ancient Greece, and expanded into an era of fine dining by the Chinese. In some cultures, wine has even developed a medicinal purpose, aiding in health and wellbeing. 			
			    <br><br>

				Today, wine has become the face of sophistication and artful dining in cultures throughout the world. Each bottle embodies a spectrum of aromas and flavors made distinct by ingredients and age. From sparkling to red, wine is an art form characterized by its hidden complexity.

		    <h1>How wine is made</h1>
				<br><br>
			    <p>
			    As expected from the extensive variety of wines currently on the market, winemaking is a complex and extensive process.Wine is developed most commonly from fermented grapes, although other fruits, including pomegranates and elderberry, have also been used to create their own distinct flavors. During the fermentation process, strains of yeast release alcohol and flavor the batch to create different styles of wine. The final product may contain thousands of unique ingredients.
